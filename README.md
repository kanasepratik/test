# Exploratory Data Analysis 

## What is Exploratory Data Analysis ?

- **Exploratory Data Analysis is one of the important steps in the data analysis process. Here, the focus is on making sense of the data in hand – things like formulating the correct questions to ask to your dataset, how to manipulate the data sources to get the required answers, and others.** 
- **This is done by taking an elaborate look at trends, patterns, and outliers using a visual method**.


Exploratory Data Analysis is a crucial step before you jump to machine learning or modeling of your data. 
It provides the context needed to develop an appropriate model – and interpret the results correctly.


Over the years, machine learning has been on the rise – and that’s given birth to a number of powerful machine learning algorithms. 
So powerful that they almost tempt you to skip the Exploratory Data Analysis phase. 
While it’s understandable why you’d want to take advantage of such algorithms and skip the EDA – It is not a very good idea to just feed data into a black box and wait for the results. 
It has been observed time and time again that Exploratory Data Analysis provides a lot of critical information which is very easy to miss – information that helps the analysis in the long run, from framing questions to displaying results.


The purpose of Exploratory Data Analysis is essential to tackle specific tasks such as:

- Spotting missing and erroneous data;
- Mapping and understanding the underlying structure of your data;
- Identifying the most important variables in your dataset;
- Testing a hypothesis or checking assumptions related to a specific model;
- Establishing a parsimonious model (one that can explain your data using minimum variables);
- Estimating parameters and figuring the margins of error.



## EDA Approach
- Understanding the variables
- Cleaning the dataset
- Analyzing relationships between variables



### Tools and Techniques used in Exploratory Data Analysis
- #### Univariate visualisation
Univariate visualisations are essentially probability distributions of each and every field in the raw dataset – with summary statistics. 
Univariate visualisations use frequency distribution tables, bar charts, histograms, or pie charts for the graphical representation.

- #### Bivariate visualisations
These allow the data scientists to assess the relationship between variables in your dataset – and helps you target the variable you’re looking at. Appropriate graphs for Bivariate Analysis depend on the type of variable in question. For instance, if you’re dealing with two continuous variables, a scatter plot should be the graph of your choice. 
If one is categorical and the other is continuous, a box plot is preferred and when both the variables are categorical, a mosaic plot is chosen.

- #### Multivariate visualisations

Multivariate visualizations help in understanding the interactions between different data-fields. 
It involves observation and analysis of more than one statistical outcome variable at any given time.

#### Exploratory Data Analysis is quite clearly one of the important steps during the whole process of knowledge extraction. If you want to set up a strong foundation for your overall analysis process, you should focus with all your strength and might on the EDA phase. 
#### In all honesty, a bit of statistics is required to ace this step.
